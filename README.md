# ISI-WFP

## Overview

The project is set within the context of food security in developing areas where a preventive intervention plays a vital role in humanitarian organizations tasked with implementing food aid programs. The main goal is to develop a machine learning technique that could extract useful features from relevant data sources, to predict food trends (eventually food crises) in different areas of interest. 

The first part of the work focuses on the analysis of two proxy indicators for food security, provided by WFP for some countries of Africa: Food Consumption Score and Reduced Coping Strategy Index. Being the values of the indicators have been collected over time, the intent is to build a model able to predict future values based on previously observed values.  

The second part of the work consists of integrating additional data sources that can fit and refine the purpose of the project. These sources could take into consideration different fields: macroeconomic indicators, nightlight intensity, undernourishment FAOâ€™s figures, market prices, rainfall, vegetation index (NDVI), conflict information (from ACLED), information from news and social media. The basic idea is to consistently combine the most relevant information from which it is possible, exploiting the machine learning algorithm, improve the effectiveness of the forecasting.


## Folder structure

The main structure with which the files are stored are the following:

- Food Consumption Score: analysis of the FCS indicator.

- Reduced Coping Strategy Index: analysis of the rCSI indicator.
