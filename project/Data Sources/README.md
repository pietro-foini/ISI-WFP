# Data-Sources

In order to investigate the food security phenomenon, we must begin by going through the exploration of appropriate data sources. The increasing demand for data in this regard has led Word Food Programme (WFP) to collect two food indicators in the last few years: the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and the Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). These indicators reflect the households' eating behavior in some African and Asian countries. After careful processing by the analysts, the collected data are presented as daily time-series. In addition to these indicators, we also consider events that could affect food security: market prices, conflicts, precipitation, vegetation, etc. To ensure that all data have the same format, we explore secondary data sources that can describe these events via time-series.
