# Data-Sources

To be able to investigate the food security phenomenon, we necessarily must go through the exploration of appropriate data sources. The increasing demand for data in this regard has led Word Food Programme (WFP) to collect some food indicators in the last few years: the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and the Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). These indicators reflect the food diet trend of the populations of some African countries. We refer to them as our endogenous data. An additional contribution to describe the phenomenon can be extrapolated from some exogenous data sources: market prices, conflicts, rainfalls, vegetation, etc.

Into these folders, we stored the data sources collected in order to predict *food security* trend.
