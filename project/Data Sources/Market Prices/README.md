# Market-Prices

Another remarkable factor for ensuring adequate food supply is the commodities trading. There are not many available sources where it is possible to find daily economic updates in all the African and Asian countries, especially as regards the food products. Fortunately, WFP monitors the prices of different commodities in multiple markets in the same country on a monthly basis. This enables us to build monthly time-series concerning food price information for some of the administrative regions of our references countries.

The variety of monitored commodities is huge but can be easily grouped into 8 main groups: 'cereals and tubers', 'meat, fish and eggs', 'milk and dairy', 'miscellaneous food', 'non-food', 'oil and fats', 'pulses and nuts', 'vegetables and fruits'. Based on preliminary analysis, the WFP' researchers identify the 'cereals and tubers' group and the 'exchange rate' commodity of the 'non-food' group as the most decisive in influencing food security. 

We download the data from The Humanitarian Data Exchange website. For more details about the data: https://data.humdata.org/.
